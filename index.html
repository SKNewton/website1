    <p>Always enjoying the present view with one eye on the next summit. I’m looking to reach new heights in my education, understanding, and appreciation for the world around me. I grew up as the daughter of an artist and an engineer, raised to respect both beauty and functionality. Finding a balance between the two is my ultimate goal. Currently, I’m gathering inspiration as an undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan while taking a deep dive into the arts community.</p>
